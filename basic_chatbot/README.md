OpenAI Chatbot Project
Welcome to the OpenAI Chatbot Project! This project demonstrates how to create text-based chatbots using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The project includes three scripts, each showcasing different aspects of chatbot development and interaction.

Scripts Overview
BLAME Script: This script generates ideas for apps by engaging in conversation with the user. It utilizes OpenAI's Chat Completion API to provide app suggestions based on user input.

Chatgpt Chat Assistance Associate Script: This script creates a simple chatbot that interacts with users based on the specified type of chatbot. Users can engage in conversation with the chatbot until they choose to exit by inputting "quit()".

Real Estate Pro Script: This script implements a web-based chat interface using Gradio, allowing users to interact with a chatbot specialized in real estate investment and negotiation. Users can input text messages, and the chatbot responds with generated replies from the GPT-3.5 model.

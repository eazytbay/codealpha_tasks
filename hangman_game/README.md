Game Rules
You have a limited number of lives, 8 to be specific. Every incorrect guess will reduce the number of lives remaining.
Guess one letter at a time. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you will lose a life.
The game ends when you guess the entire word correctly or when you run out of lives.
Have fun and try to guess as many words as you can!
